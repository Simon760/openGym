# Building the mobile app (iOS / Android)

openGym ships in two flavors from the same codebase:

| | **Self-hosted** (this repo's default) | **Mobile app** (`VITE_MOBILE=1`) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | in any browser, against your own server | natively on iPhone / Android (Capacitor shell) |
| Accounts | passkey sign-in, one profile per person | none — the phone *is* the account |
| Data | synced to your server, readable on desktop | stays on the device (file in the app's private storage) |
| Reminders | Web Push from your server | native local notifications, no server involved |
| Exercise media | served by your server (`img/`, `gif/`) | loaded from the jsDelivr CDN |

The mobile flavor never talks to a backend: no sign-in screen, no sync, no telemetry.
State is mirrored from `localStorage` into `opengym-state.json` in the app's private data
directory on every change (iOS is allowed to evict WebView storage under pressure — the
file mirror is the durable copy and is restored on launch). Backups go out through the
OS share sheet instead of a browser download.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- **Android:** Android Studio (bundles the SDK). Java 21 for Gradle.
- **iOS:** a Mac with Xcode 15+ and CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods`). A free Apple ID
  is enough to run the app on your own iPhone (see below); paid membership is only needed
  for App Store distribution, which openGym doesn't do.

## Build & run

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build:mobile        # VITE_MOBILE build + `cap sync` into android/ and ios/

npx cap open android        # opens Android Studio → run on emulator or device
npx cap open ios            # opens Xcode (Mac only) → set your signing team, then run
```

`npm run build:mobile` bakes the CDN media base into the bundle and copies the web build
into both native projects — re-run it after every web-code change before building natively.

> **Heads-up:** after `build:mobile`, `frontend/dist` contains the *mobile* bundle.
> Run a plain `npm run build` again before deploying `dist` to a server.

## App icons & splash screens

`frontend/resources/icon.svg` is the 1024×1024 source (the app's dumbbell glyph on the
app background). Generate all platform assets from it on a machine with the tooling:

```sh
cd frontend
npx @capacitor/assets generate --iconBackgroundColor '#0c0e12' --splashBackgroundColor '#0c0e12'
```

(If the generator won't take the SVG directly, export it to `resources/icon.png` at
1024×1024 first — any image tool can do it.)

## Distribution — deliberately no app stores

openGym's mobile app is not on the Play Store or App Store, and that's a choice: no store
accounts, no store rules, no yearly fees between you and an open-source app.

### Android — sideload the APK

The official signed APK is at **[opengym.duarte-santos.ch](https://opengym.duarte-santos.ch)**.
Android asks you to allow installs from the browser the first time — that's standard for any
app outside the Play Store.

To build and sign your own:

```sh
cd frontend && npm run build:mobile
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease            # → app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk

# one-time: create a keystore. KEEP IT — updates must be signed with the same key,
# or Android refuses to install the new version over the old one.
keytool -genkeypair -keystore my.keystore -alias opengym -keyalg RSA -validity 10950

# align + sign (zipalign/apksigner ship with the Android SDK build-tools)
zipalign -f -p 4 app-release-unsigned.apk aligned.apk
apksigner sign --ks my.keystore --ks-key-alias opengym --out openGym.apk aligned.apk
```

### iPhone — what's actually possible

Apple does not allow installing apps outside the App Store, so there is no `.ipa` download
that would simply install. Your free options:

- **Self-host + PWA** (recommended): open your instance in Safari → Share → *Add to Home
  Screen*. Full-screen app, no expiry, plus sync and passkeys.
- **Xcode free signing:** open `ios/` in Xcode with a free Apple ID as the team and run it
  onto your own iPhone. Apple expires the signature after 7 days; re-run from Xcode to renew.
- **AltStore:** automates that 7-day re-signing over Wi-Fi via a Mac companion app.

### Release notes for maintainers

- Bump `versionName`/`versionCode` in `android/app/build.gradle` per release; keep them in
  step with `frontend/package.json`. `versionCode` must strictly increase or updates won't
  install over an existing APK.
- **License:** openGym is AGPL-3.0, which by itself sits badly with app-store terms of
  service. `NOTICE.md` carries an app-store exception (an additional permission under
  AGPL §7) granted by the copyright holder — relevant only if store distribution ever happens.
- The app requests notification permission only when the workout-day reminder is switched
  on, and (on Android) declares `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` so the reminder fires to the minute
  where the user allows it.

## Getting Apple Watch data in, without building an iOS app

HealthKit needs a native iOS build, which needs a Mac and Xcode — and a paid Apple Developer
membership ($99/yr) for anything beyond a provisioning profile that expires every 7 days.
There is a free path that gets you more: an **Apple Shortcut**.

Shortcuts reads Health natively (steps, active energy, sleep, workouts, heart rate) and can
be triggered *by the watch finishing a session*. No Mac, no developer account, no App Store.

**The shortcut.** Settings → Import from your watch → *Copy the recipe* gives you the exact
actions. In outline:

1. `Find Health Samples` · Steps · Today · Calculate Sum
2. `Find Health Samples` · Active Energy · Today · Calculate Sum
3. `Find Health Samples` · Sleep Analysis · **yesterday 18:00 → now** · Calculate Sum
4. `Find Workouts` · Sort by End Date · Latest 1
5. A `Text` action assembling them into JSON
6. `Copy to Clipboard` — or `Get Contents of URL` (POST) once your instance is online

> Never query sleep on "Today". A night starts yesterday and ends today, so the obvious
> filter cuts it in half. openGym files a night under the day you woke up, for the same
> reason — the two agree without anything having to be negotiated.

**Two ways to fire it, one shortcut:**

- **Automation → Workout → Ends.** Your watch finishes the session, your iPhone runs the
  shortcut. Nothing to remember.
- **Home Screen icon, Back Tap, or the Shortcuts app on the watch**, to force it whenever
  you want — a missed sync, or a session you trained without starting one on the watch.

**What lands where.** Steps, active energy and resting heart rate become the day's activity
figures; sleep goes to the sleep log; a weight (and body fat, if your scale reports it)
becomes a weigh-in. The workout's duration, energy and heart rate are **added to the session
you already logged in openGym that day** — never as a second session. Two records of one
training session have to stay one session, or every count in the app doubles. If nothing was
logged that day, the import says the session details had nowhere to go and keeps the rest.

Every field is optional. A shortcut that only ever sends steps is a complete shortcut.
